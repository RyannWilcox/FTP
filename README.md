## File Transfer Protocol

I plan on trying to create a FTP server and client using python. <br>
This project is mostly for fun and for practice using python <br>
I have been using pyftpdlib for setting up the server. Download this library at: <br> [https://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/] (https://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/) <br>


This project is a work in progress...
